<!-- This is a placeholder for an actual image file. In a real project, you would need to upload a real JPG file here. -->
<!-- For now, I'll create a script that generates a placeholder image at runtime. -->
// This would be a binary image file. Since we can't include binary content directly,
// our placeholder.js script will generate a placeholder image instead.
